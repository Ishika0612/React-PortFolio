            <h3>Hi, I’m <span>Ishika Kaushik</span>  </h3>
            <p>A passionate frontend developer who loves transforming ideas into sleek, responsive, and engaging digital experiences. I specialize in crafting clean user interfaces using modern web technologies like React, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on creating designs that not only look great but feel effortless to use.</p>
            <p>I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech in Information Technology (4th year) from Dr. Ambedkar Institue of Technology for Handicapped, Kanpur, maintaining an aggregate CGPA of 8.2. Alongside my academics, I have a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, which enables me to write efficient, scalable, and performance-driven solutions.</p>
            <p>My journey in tech started with curiosity — a desire to understand how websites worked behind the scenes. Over time, that curiosity grew into a deep passion for web development, UI/UX design, and algorithmic problem-solving. I enjoy blending creativity with logic, turning concepts into interactive, user-friendly products.</p>
